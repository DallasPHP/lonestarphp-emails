Hello [[name]],

Thank you for submitting your ideas to Lone Star PHP!  This year we
received over 400 submissions.  With all the great submissions
came many very difficult choices. Unfortunately, the sessions you submitted
were not accepted this year.

There were so many great submissions but with limited speaker slots, there were
many we just couldn't include. Coming up with a conference schedule is never
easy, and we've done our best to craft a conference that is both informative
and challenging to those who will attend.

We encourage you to continue submitting your talks and ideas to other
conferences and to stay involved in the PHP community. We would still love for
you to attend Lone Star PHP this year, though. Early Bird tickets are still on sale,
so be sure to pick up your passes at this limited-time discounted rate!
